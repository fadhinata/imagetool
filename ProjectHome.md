This program supports buffering, color conversion, geometric drawing and creating (convex hull, delaunay triangulation, and etc), image processing (hough transform, labeling, morphological operation and etc), matrix operation, and regression. Current development environment is gcc-based development in linux machine. Later, I want to add examples, documents, and GUI such as GTK-based.
